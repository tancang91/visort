# Visual sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithm visualization written in Rust as learning projects

## Goals

- [ ] Sorting algorithms:
    - [X] Insertion sort
    - [X] Bubble sort
    - [X] Selection sort
    - [X] Quick sort
    - [ ] Merge sort
    - [ ] Heap sort

- [X] Visualization: Simple visualization for algorithms
